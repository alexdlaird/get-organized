welcome=Welcome
first1=Welcome to Get Organized, a program that allows you to add your Course load at the beginning of a Term and helps you to never forget an Assignment again!  But Get Organized doesn't just help you to organize Assignments, projects, and exams; it lets you organize your social life as well. Before diving in and using this program, please use the Next and Previous buttons to look over some of the features that are available to you.
addingTermsAndCourses=Adding Terms and Courses
first2=First things first. You'll want to add a Term with a specific start and end date. At any point, you are able to edit Course and Term details by clicking the Courses button.
addingTermsAndCoursesCont=Adding Terms and Courses, cont.
second1=Next, you'll want to add a Course. Courses are tied directly to a specific Term and are very customizable. You can specify details such as meeting time and location, Instructors, Textbooks, and a Grading Scale. The more details you add for a Course, the more features of the program will be available to you.
gradingScaleAndTextbooks=Grading Scale and Textbooks
second2=<div align="right">When you get a syllabus for a course, your professor will have broken down your overall grade into categories, such as projects, exams, quizzes, homework, etc. These are referred to as "Types". Each Type in the Grading Scale has a weight associated with it,</div>
gradingScaleAndTextbooksCont=Grading Scale and Textbooks, cont.
third1=which can be taken directly from the syllabus. The Grading Scale is specific to each Course, and can be edited in the Course details. <br /><br /> Both Types and Textbooks are only specific to the course they are added to. For instance, if US History I and Microeconomics both have "Group Projects", you will need to add this Type to both Courses. Textbooks can also be added to a Course.<br /><br /> Finally, when Assignments are created and tied to a Course, Types and Textbooks attached only to that Course will be available to that Assignment.
assignmentsAndEvents=Assignments and Events
fourth1=<div align="right">Assignments are tied directly to a Course. They have details such as a due date and time, Textbook, Type (from the Grading Scale), priority, and grade (if completed).<br /><br /> Events are not tied to any Course or Term. Events can have a start and end time, they can be all day, or they can be repeating. Event Categories can be added and edited by clicking the Settings button.<br /><br />Both Assignments and Events can easily be duplicated by clicking the Clone button; and for easier or organization, can be color-coded by placing them into a Course (Assignments) or a Category (Events).</div>
viewsAndFilters=Views and Filters
fifth1=Get Organized has two views:  List View and Calendar View. List View shows a list of all Assignments and Events, showing more details about each item, while Calendar View allows you to see them placed into their days in the month. Assignments and Events are colored by default according to the Course's color. In Settings, you can change how these are colored.<br /><br /> Filters can be applied so that the views will show everything, or only things pertaining to a certain criteria. Criteria filters are along the top of the views, but selecting a Course will only display Assignments attached to that Course. Selecting the top-level Term again will remove the Course filter.<br /><br />The Mini Calendar marks today as green, free days as black, and days on which Assignments or events are due as red. Days on which all due Assignments have already been completed are marked as Blue.
sortingInListView=Sorting in List View
sixth1=<div align="right">Assignments and Events can be sorted by clicking on the desired column's header. By default, they are sorted by due date, but they can be sorted by any column. The column they are currently sorted by is shown as bold in the header. If no header is bold, the items are being sorted on the basis of completion (the far left column).<br /><br />Assignments and Events can be sorted in two orders: ascending and descending. To swap the order, simply click on the bold column header again. Sorting preferences are saved when the program is closed. So, next time you open Get Organized, your Assignments and Events will still be sorted in the same way you left them!</div>
gradeBook=Grades
seventh1=Grades for a term can easily be seen at a glance in the Grades window. Individual Course grades are calculated for you based on grades you have entered for completed Assignments. A graph is provided to show your progress for each Course throughout the currently selected Term. Your Course grade is summarized at the bottom of the Grades window to show your average grades for each type within the Course. <br /><br /> Grades can only be calculated properly if you have completed the Grading Scale for each Course and have given grades to completed Assignments. If a grade is reported as "N/A", make sure you have created a Grading Scale for that Course and have given a grade to at least one completed Assignment for that Course.
