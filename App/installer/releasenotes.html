            <p>If you have a Windows or Mac system, please download and use the appropriate installers from alexlaird.com.  Otherwise, use the following instructions to install from the portable version found at alexlaird.com.</span></p>

            <ul><li>Download and install the JRE.</li>

            <li>Download the latest portable version of Get Organized.</li>

            <li>Unzip the Get Organized JAR into its own folder on your computer.</li>

            <ul><li>If you are installing the portable version locally, for instance on Linux, place the application in its own folder in your home folder:  ~/Get Organized</li>

            <li>If you are installing the portable version on a flash drive, simply place it in its own folder anywhere on the flash drive.</li>

            <li>The application does need its <i>own</i> folder, so wherever you put it, make sure it’s within a “Get Organized Portable” folder</li></ul>

            <li>For simplicity, create a shortcut to the JAR and put it on your desktop and/or in your Start Menu</li>

            <li>On most systems, you can now just double-click on the JAR or the shortcut and the application should launch</li>

            <ul><li>On some Unix-based systems, you will need to execute the JAR from the command-line using the following command:  <em>java -jar Get\ Organized.jar</em></li></ul>
